    								This specific game is currently set to run tick() to update the game once every 16.67 milliseconds.
    								This is not an arbitrary amount of milliseconds. The number 16.67 comes from the following calculations:
									
									One second = 1000 ms
									Target framerate = 60 fps (frames/second)
									Since the 60 comes from the following division: 

									frames/1 sec = 60

									seconds/frame = 1/60
									ms/frame = 1000/60 â‰ˆ 16.67

									According to these calculations, the game should update 60 times per second, if it updates once every 16.67 ms
